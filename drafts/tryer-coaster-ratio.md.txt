# Tryer/Coaster Ratio

Some employees try to do a good job and try to solve problems in the organization.
We call them *engaged* employees.
I will coin the term *tryer* to mean an engaged employee, someone who tries to do a good job.

Other employees have given up, or never cared in the first place.
They do their job but don't try to do it very well.
They don't try to solve problems outside their direct job responsibilities.
We call them *unengaged* employees. We say they are *coasting*.
I will use the word *coaster* to mean an unengaged employee.

I tend to be a tryer, although there have been times in my career when I coasted.

When an organization has mostly tryers, they can get a lot done.
As the tryers leave or lose motivation, the number of tryers goes down and the number of coasters goes up.
When this happens, the organization becomes less efficient and accomplishes less.

Therefore, the success of an organization depends upon the ratio of tryers to coasters, the T/C ratio.
It also depends on the T/C of critical parts of the organization, like management, sales, and production.

## Techniques for Increasing T/C

- Careful hiring: Set up the hiring process to pass only tryers.
  Examples: Jane Street, pre-IPO Google, Notion.
  Careful hiring has some negative side effects:
    - spending a lot of energy on hiring
    - cannot hire people who would quickly become tryers once they join
- PIP culture: Use frequent performance reviews and threats of firing to make everyone try or pretend to try.
  Examples: Amazon, Snowflake, Netflix.
  PIP culture has strong negative side effects:
    - damaged employee health
    - high turnover
    - incentivizing immoral behavior like hiring to fire
    - smaller hiring pool
- Perf culture, performance-based pay:
  Pay more to employees who demonstrate positive impact of their work.
  Examples: post-IPO Google, Facebook.
  Perf culture has strong negative side effects:
    - Everyone is incentivized to game their team's metrics, so metrics become useless for business decisions.
      Example: Facebook's degeneration from a fun and useful communication tool
      into a machine that deftly manipulates users into consuming garbage content.
    - Unglamorous work doesn't get done. For example, this is why Flutter is in version 3 and still has
      [poor location support](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/31453),
      its iOS support is full of [problems](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/80860),
      and it [cannot cancel HTTP requests](https://github.com/dart-lang/http/issues/424).
    - Engineers make systems unnecessarily sophisticated, adding tech debt.
    - The organization spends a lot of energy launching and maintaining duplicate projects.
      New systems are built to replace old systems, but the old systems are never turned down.

## Ideas for Increasing T/C

- Train employees to identify when they are at risk of becoming unengaged, changing from a tryer into a coaster.
  Encourage them to seek assistance from manager, mentor, and senior teammates.
- Train managers to identify when a teammate is at risk of becoming unengaged.
- Train managers to consult with the teammate and offer support and options: changing priorities, moving to a different
  project, starting a new project, escalation, etc.
- Train executive team on T/C
    - Use surveys to measure T/C across the organization
    - Discuss T/C at organization-wide meetings
    - Own T/C problems
- Ad-hoc bonuses for trying to solve problems outside of one's direct responsibility, given out by managers to ICs
  outside their subordinate tree.
- Remove incentives for coasters to stay longer than they want to:
    - When a manager identifies a coaster, convert all their outstanding equity grants to base salary increases and pay
      bonuses early, prorated
    - Eliminate vesting cliffs and bonuses for new or all employees.
- Help coasters find jobs at other organizations
    - Recruiting team to organize practice interviews and host office hours for resume reviews, LinkedIn profile
      reviews, cover letter reviews, offer negotiation advice
    - Referral club
    - Education subsidy with stipend & insurance. Help the coaster go to grad school.
- Sabbatical with stipend & insurance.
  The cost of paying the stipend is much less than the opportunity cost to the organization of having a coaster in a
  role instead of a tryer.
  They may come back from sabbatical as a tryer.
- Make everyone an owner.  Examples: Jane Street.
    - Grant every org member shares
    - New hires get a slice of every existing member's shares
    - Pay is dividends from vested and unvested shares
    - When a person leaves the org, they keep their vested shares
    - Only a current employee can vote their shares.

Bad ideas:

- Make job level fluid
    - A coasting L6 engineer may perform like a trying L5, and gets paid accordingly.
    - Manager decides performance level per-quarter, with weekly check-ins.
    - Engineer is paid at the level of their previous quarter's performance.
    - No penalty for performing 2 levels down.
    - Job title changes to the highest level of previous two quarters.
    - This method has the same downsides as Perf Culture, and probably worse.
