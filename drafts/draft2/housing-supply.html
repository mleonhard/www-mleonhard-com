    </ol>
    In 2011, SF jobs increased 2% (see [1] page 5) and housing increased
    0.07% (see [10] page 4).
    In 2012, SF jobs increased 5% (see [2] page 5) and housing increased
    0.4% (see [11] page 4).
    In 2013, SF jobs increased 5% (see [3] page 5) and housing increased
    0.9% (see [12] page 4).
    In 2014, SF jobs increased 5% (see [4] page 5) and housing increased
    1% (see [13] page 5).
    In 2015, SF jobs increased 5% (see [5] page 5) and housing increased
    1% (see [14] page 5).
    In 2016, SF jobs increased 4% (see [6] page 5) and housing increased
    1% (see [15] page 5).
    In 2017, SF jobs increased 1.6% (see [7] page 5) and housing increased
    1% (see [16] page 5).
    In 2018, SF jobs increased 3.6% (see [8] page 5) and housing increased
    0.7% (see [17] page 5).
    SF's job growth numbers for 2019 are not yet published on the city's
    website [9]. An economic advisory firm estimated 3.5% growth [19].
    In 2019, SF housing increased 1.2% (see [18] page 5).

    Let's summarize these numbers: Over the last ten years (2010-2019), SF
    jobs have grown from 546,965 to 766,728 (which is 2018's 740,800 plus
    3.5%). This is 40% growth in jobs. In that same time, housing grew
    from 372,560 units to 399,313. This is 7% growth in housing.

    All those new people working in SF have to live somewhere. And they
    can't live in SF because you and your fellow board members did not
    approve enough housing for them. So instead, they must spend several
    hours every day sitting in traffic, on busses, and on BART. That is
    poor quality of life. Have you experienced this kind of commute for
    years?

    People need to live near their jobs. When jobs grow, then housing
    demand increases. Because of the Law of Supply and Demand (Economics
    101), when demand increases without a corresponding increase in
    supply, prices go up. This is why housing prices in SF increased when
    jobs increased 40% and housing supply increased only 7%.

    Median 2BR home price went from $560,980 in 2010 (see [10] page 24])
    to $1,450,000 in 2019 (see [18] page 38). That's a 158% increase.

    Median monthly rent for a 2BR home in SF went from $2,737 in 2010 (see
    [10] page 24) to $3,720 in 2019 (see [18] page 38). That's a 36%
    increase. This 36% number is misleading because it lumps together
    folks with rent control and those without it. SF's 160,000
    rent-controlled units (see [22]) had a maximum rent increase of 13%
    from 2010 through 2019 (see [21]). Folks who moved to SF for the new
    jobs had difficulty finding rent-controlled units. Their rents have
    gone up much more, as reflected by the large jump in median rent.

    I estimate that the market rate for lower-end rentals increased about
    100% over those 9 years. My own rent went up 20% in one year alone.
    In 2012, I rented a dark 2BR in-law apartment in Visitacion Valley for
    $1150/mo. Similar apartments in the same neighborhood are now $2250
    (see [20]). That's a 95% increase.

    Now let's talk about you. According to one website [23], your net
    worth is "10s of millions of dollars." If we assume that number is
    $10M and half of it is in Bay Area real estate, then over the
    2010-2019 time period, you have profited about $5M from the plight of
    renters and homeless. Are these numbers reasonable estimates?

    YOU MUST WORK HARDER ON THE HOUSING SHORTAGE! And I mean work harder
    to eliminate it, not make it worse. Please.

    The status-quo is callous exploitation of the poor, middle-class, and
    young people. They are suffering. They are crammed into decrepit
    buildings. Everyone has roommates. Living alone is an incredible
    luxury. Why should life be like this? When young people move here to
    take jobs and build the Bay Area's growing economy, their impression
    of the locals is "I've got mine, f*** you." I've heard this phrase
    from multiple 20-somethings who came here for professional jobs at top
    companies. Their disappointment is palpable. My friends who grew up
    here in working-class families struggle with housing. They know they
    can't have what their parents have. Do you live in a rich white
    Boomer bubble? Please realize that many people are suffering. You
    and the other board members are sitting on your hands and ignoring the
    problem of a generation. PLEASE DO SOMETHING!

    For a concrete local example in your district, consider the boarded-up
    building at 1640 Polk St. It will be demolished and replaced with
    single-story retail [24]. This is a sad waste of an opportunity to
    add at least 70 units of housing above that retail space. Why isn't
    that happening? One reason is that it takes too long to get a permit.
    According to UC Berkeley research [25], getting a permit to build
    housing in SF takes nearly 4 years! During this time, buildings
    usually sit unused. Who pays the cost of that unused capital? The
    renters & buyers of course. The costs get passed on to the market
    (us). The permitting delay is a large part of the cost of housing in
    SF. You and your fellow board members are responsible for this delay.

    So please, if you really care about the homeless, you must work to
    increase the housing supply and eliminate the CRUSHING HOUSING
    SHORTAGE. Let's get housing prices down to a reasonable level. Once
    that happens, marginal units will be priced within reach of nearly all
    homeless people and they will stop being homeless. For example, the
    SRO at 1499 California St used to have rooms for $500/mo. Now it has
    fancy renovated rooms with shiny appliances for $1700/mo [26]. Nobody
    can afford that on a social security check. This gentrification of
    SROs is a big loss for the poor in our city.

    My heart breaks every day as I walk past these people suffering on the
    street. Do you walk in the city? I suppose you drive a fancy car
    between home and work, with valet parking at City Hall. I challenge
    you to get out and see how people live in your city. Meet them.
    Listen to them. Don't wear your suit.

    Once the housing crisis is solved, we won't need to spend $300M/year
    for homeless support. Let's spend that money on mental hospitals for
    those who are suffering the most. They deserve care. We are a rich
    city. A rich society. We can do this. We should. You should.

    Sincerely,
    Michael
