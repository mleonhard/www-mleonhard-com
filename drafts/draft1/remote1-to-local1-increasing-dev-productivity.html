<h1>Remote1 to Local1: Boosting Dev Productivity</h1>
<p>2025-03-21</p>
<section>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The pace of software development is limited by two things: 1) figuring out how the thing works and 2)
            testing code changes.
        </li>
        <li>We can classify code testing by where the tests run: locally, in the cloud, in production, etc.</li>
        <li>There are lots of ways to improve tests. The highest-ROI is in moving the tests closer to the engineer.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Detail</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>When people develop a software system, they usually use this process:
            <img src="software-system-lifecycle.svg" style="width: 25rem;" alt="Software System Lifecycle Diagram">
            <ol>
                <li>Step "3. Change a function" includes adding, changing, fixing, and removing system functions.</li>
                <li>Nearly all the effort spent on the system over its lifetime is spent in "3. Change a function".</li>
                <li>Multiple developers perform this step concurrently.</li>
                <li>When developers can do step 3 faster, the organization's engineering work gets done
                    faster.
                </li>
                <li>Faster engineering means new products and features become available quicker. For a
                    business, speeding up step 3 brings faster time-to-market, increased revenue, and better
                    cost-efficiency.
                </li>
                <li>Faster engineering also reduces the time to repair the system when it has problems.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Let's look more closely at this step:
            <img src="dev-cycle.svg" style="width: 35rem;" alt="Dev Cycle Diagram">
        </li>
        <li>Ways to speed it up:
            <ol>
                <li>Make each step faster</li>
                <li>Reduce the number of iterations</li>
                <li>Discover problems earlier</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Make each step faster:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Decide what it will do differently
                    <ol>
                        <li>Have a single person who decides this, a Directly Responsible Individual (DRI)</li>
                        <li>Get stakeholders to review designs before changing code</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Read code & learn how it works
                    <ol>
                        <li>Make code clarity the top priority</li>
                        <li>A good ordered set of priorities: clarity, resilience, performance</li>
                        <li>Use languages and libraries with good documentation</li>
                        <li>Organize code into modules, grouped by business function, not type</li>
                        <li>Use example tests. These are tests that use literals to specify input and expected output
                            data. Literals are more clear than data made with helper functions.
                        </li>
                        <li>Ban code inheritance. Interface inheritance is fine.</li>
                        <li>Ban runtime dependency injection frameworks (<a
                                href="https://github.com/google/guice">Guice</a>, <a
                                href="https://uber-go.github.io/fx/">Fx</a>) and instead have <code>main()</code>
                            construct all the
                            things.
                        </li>
                        <li>Use linter rules to restrict depth of indentation, number of function parameters, lines per
                            function, lines per file, complexity of types, etc. To disable a rule, require the
                            code author to add their name and an explanation of why breaking the rule is the best
                            choice.
                        </li>
                        <li>Use a type-checked language</li>
                        <li>Ban type-checking escape hatches (TypeScript's <code>any</code>, Rust's <code>unsafe</code>,
                            etc.)
                        </li>
                        <li>Ban reflection</li>
                        <li>Designate a Documentation Manager to make teams maintain minimal documentation.</li>
                        <li>Invest in reducing technical debt</li>
                        <li>Keep developer turnover low</li>
                        <li>Quickly migrate off legacy systems and turn them off.</li>
                        <li>Keep systems simple</li>
                        <li>Use a monolith, not microservices.</li>
                    </ol>

                        <li>Prioritize tests that are more likely to fail</li>
                        <li>Notify developer when one fails or all succeed</li>

                                <li>Prioritize reviews over other work</li>
                                <li>Provide only actionable feedback</li>
                                <li>Provide concrete suggested changes</li>

                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Automatically assign reviews to available developers</li>
                        <li>Use real-time notifications of review requests</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Merge

                <li>Deploy & Verify in Production
                    <ol>

                        <li>Release automatically</li>

                        <li>Monitor and optimize release performance</li>
                        <li>Update PR descriptions with verification performed: shell sessions showing commands run and
                            their output, links to dashboards and screenshots. This info is available for verifying
                            future changes.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Rollback
                    <ol>
                        <li>For risky changes, use feature flags to rollback and don't revert. When we skip a revert, we
                            also skip
                            reverting the revert.
                        </li>
                        <li>Perform incident review for every rollback. Designate an incident review manager who makes
                            them happen.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Step "1. Read code & learn how it works" takes effort depending on the developer's familiarity with
            the system and the system's complexity, structure, tech debt, rate of change, and documentation.
        </li>
        <li>Step "4. Test updated code" is critical for developer productivity:
            <ol>
                <li>The developer performs it after every code change.</li>
                <li>Changes to complex applications can require tens or hundreds of code changes, especially
                    when
                    adding tests.
                </li>
                <li>When this step is slow, the developer spends most of their time waiting on it. This can harm
                    morale.
                </li>
                <li>For example, the author once worked on a Rails application that took 60s to load the
                    application and begin executing test code. One day, the author built a complex integration
                    test requiring about 120 code changes and spent an aggregate 2 hours that day just waiting
                    for
                    Ruby to load code.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
