    <h2>A Web App must Update the Page</h2>
    It's 2023 and many companies publish complex apps that run through the web browser.
    Browsers support two ways to update a page, each with serious problems:
    <ul>
        <li>HTML form post - The big problem with posting an HTML form is that the browser treats it as navigating to a
            new page which has poor UX: it scrolls to the top, un-focuses widgets, and resets user-input widgets.
        </li>
        <li>JavaScript
            <ul>
                <li>apps must have expensive RPC code to move data between the frontend and backend</li>
                <li>frontend and backend are deployed separately so the various versions talk to each other, creating a
                    class of bugs
                </li>
                <li>the JavaScript language is poor (missing modules, static types, integers, threads, etc.)</li>
                <li>app makers must use different languages for frontend and backend, or pay the significant cost of
                    JavaScript on the backend
                </li>
                <li>the tools are poor</li>
                <li>browser APIs are poor and inconsistent</li>
                <li>enables mass surveillance and profiling</li>
                <li>makes browsers insecure</li>
                <li>makes web-apps insecure</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    Outline:
    - How web apps can update the page
    - Problems with HTML form post and JavaScript
    - Break down the problem: we need to let the user manipulate widgets, send their state to the server, and update the
    page.
    - Other ways: Turbo, htmx, Phoenix.
    - New: HTML Update
    - Introduce update.js
    - Another way to make it fast: DocPatch.
