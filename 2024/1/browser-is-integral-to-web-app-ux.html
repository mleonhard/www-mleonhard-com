<h1>The Browser is Integral to Web App UX</h1>
<p>mleonhard, 2024-04-06.
<section>
    <p>The browser is an integral part of any webapp experience.

    <p>If you're making a webapp, carefully consider how your app will behave when you invoke various browser functions.

    <ol>
        <li>Open a bookmark, click a link in email or slack:
            <ol>
                <li>Do I see the same content that was visible when I copied the link?
                <li>Can I open a link from another user?
                <li>Can I get links to popups and expanding content?
                <li>Can I read a link and know what it points to? Ex: /invoices/123.
                <li>Are links short or long? When I email a link, will it get cut into multiple lines?
                <li>Can I tell a link to someone verbally? Are there mixed-case letters or obscure symbols?
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Back & Forward:
            <ol>
                <li>Will this navigate between breadcrumb items (screens)?
                <li>Will it show/hide popups or open/close expanding content?
                <li>Will it undo/redo changes to things on the page?
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Refresh:
            <ol>
                <li>Do breadcrumbs stay?
                <li>Does it keep unsaved changes?
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>I make some changes and then close the tab, refresh, or click a link:
            <ol>
                <li>Does it keep my changes for later?
                <li>Does it warn me and let me stay on the page?
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>I save changes, but it fails:
            <ol>
                <li>Does it tell me that it didn't save?
                <li>Does the message stay on the screen, hard to miss?
                <li>Can I try saving again?
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>I open the app in two browser windows:
            <ol>
                <li>Can I navigate in both windows separately?
                <li>Does each window have its own breadcrumbs?
                <li>What if I change the same content in two windows?
                <li>What if two people change the same content?
                <li>If I make a change but saving fails, then someone changes and saves, then I save, whose changes are
                    saved?
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>I middle-click a link:
            <ol>
                <li>Does a new tab open?
                <li>Can I middle-click a bunch of links and let them load in the background?
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>I click a PDF or other file that my browser can show:
            <ol>
                <li>Does it show in the browser, or do I have to save it my computer before looking at it?
                <li>Does it open in a new tab?
                <li>Can I middle-click to open it in a new tab?
                <li>If I send the link to someone, can they view it?
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>When we deploy a new version of the app:
            <ol>
                <li>Can I continue working normally?
                <li>Does it lose my unsaved changes?
                <li>Does it close everything and show the homepage?
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>When content is taller than the browser window:
            <ol>
                <li>Does a scrollbar appear?
                <li>Is the scrollbar handle clearly visible?
                <li>Can I drag the handle?
                <li>Can I use the mouse scroll wheel? Does it scroll like other apps on my computer?
                <li>Can I drag my finger to scroll it?
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>When content is wider than the browser window:
            <ol>
                <li>Does the content flow or resize, so I can use vertical scrolling to see it?
                <li>Does the content extend offscreen and require horizontal scrolling? If so, is there a visual
                    indicator,
                    an
                    affordnace?
                <li>Is the scrollbar handle clearly visible?
                <li>Can I drag the handle?
                <li>Can I drag my finger to scroll it?
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Accessibility, inclusive design:
            <ol>
                <li>Can I pinch to zoom the page?
                <li>When I zoom, does all content resize accordingly?
                <li>Does the app use my browser's font size setting?
                <li>Are modals scrollable, buttons reachable on zoomed screens?
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
