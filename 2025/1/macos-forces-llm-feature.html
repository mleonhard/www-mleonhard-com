    <h2>What Happened</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>I got a new Apple laptop and turned off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri">Siri</a> and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Intelligence">Apple
            Intelligence</a> features.
        </li>
        <li>I updated macOS and was forced to click a button.
            <ol>
                <li>I updated my new M4 MacBook Pro from macOS Sequoia 15.3.1 to 15.3.2.</li>
                <li>After installing the update, the OS restarted and showed this dialog:
                    <br/>

                </li>
                <li>“Back” is disabled.</li>
                <li>Pressing “ESC” does nothing.</li>
                <li>To continue using my laptop, I must click “Continue”.</li>
                <li>I clicked “Continue” and the dialog disappeared and my laptop finished starting.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Apple Intelligence was secretly turned on!
            <ol>
                <li>
                    I opened Settings and clicked on “Apple Intelligence & Siri” and saw that the Apple Intelligence
                    toggle is enabled:<br/>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Turning off the toggle shows a confirmation screen:<br/>

    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Poor button label
            <ol>
                <li>Using a “Continue” button to enable a system feature is misleading. This breaks with Apple's own
                    published guidelines:
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Ensure that each button clearly communicates its purpose.</p>
                        <p>A button always includes a text label or a symbol (or interface icon) — and sometimes a
                            combination of both — to help people predict what it does.</p>
                        <p>— <a
                                href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/buttons#Best-practices">Apple

                </li>
                <li>To clearly communicate its purpose, the button can be labeled “Enable”.</li>
                <li>Many users would not realize that clicking “Continue” enabled the feature.</li>
                <li>Some users do not want the feature enabled. To align their computer with their preferences, they
                    must disable the Apple Intelligence feature after clicking “Continue”.
                </li>
                <li>In UX design, an
                    <em>error</em> is when a user operates the machine in a way that contradicts their desires. Much of
                    the work of UX design is helping users avoid making errors.
                </li>
                <li>The macOS users in both categories (not realizing and not wanting), will fail to disable Apple
                    Intelligence, an error.
                </li>
                <li>The poor button label leads Apple customers to make errors.</li>
            </ol>

        <li>
            Missing “Skip” button
            <ol>
                <li>The system requires users to enable Apple Intelligence to continue using their computer.</li>
                <li>
                    Industry best-practice is to give users control over their software.

                                <p>Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked “emergency exit”
                                    to
                                    leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process.</p>
                                <p>When it's easy for people to back out of a process or undo an action, it fosters a
                                    sense
                                    of freedom and confidence. Exits allow users to remain in control of the system and
                                    avoid getting stuck and feeling frustrated.</p>

                <li>By omitting the “Skip” option, Apple took control away from their users over the feature. They
                    designed the software to force users to enable Apple Intelligence.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The design of the Apple Intelligence setup dialog indicates that Apple is deprioritizing user-centered
            design. This is troubling to me as a long-term Apple customer.
        </li>
        <li>I urge Apple's board to demand that CEO Tim Cook and SVP Machine Learning and AI Strategy <a
                href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johngiannandrea/">John Giannandrea</a> return to the user-centered
            design that made Apple great.
        </li>
        <li>Spicy version: Apple execs Tim Cook and John Giannandrea use dirty trick to drive adoption of “AI” feature,
            burning long-term user trust for a short-term stock bump.
